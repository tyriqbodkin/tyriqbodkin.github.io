<div class="para">
	<p>My name is Tyriq. I am determined to learn more about coding and venture into the field of tech through Per Scholas! My love for creating is one of the main reasons I became fascinated with the world of software engineering. Moving away from tech, I enjoy being out in nature and playing piano. Click 'Hobbies' in the navigation bar or <a href="pages/hobbies.html">here</a> to learn more about my hobbies/interests. I spend the most of my time with my family and my girlfriend, and I'm excited to show them all the things I learn. As I create this page, I grow more and more excited to get learn with Per Scholas and be a part of this group.</p>

	<h3>Tech-related Interests</h3>
</div>
	<hr>
<div id="intlist">
	<p>Some things I find interesting are:
		<ul class="interests">
			<li>AI</li>
			<li>CSS Art</li>
			<li>Game Development</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p>I find these interesting because I don't really understand them but I see people do some amazing things in each of these topics and I like seeing how they achieve the end result. For example, watching people put prompts into an AI and then receive an image back is super cool to me and I enjoy seeing what gets created. To give another example, I scroll through the TikTok accounts of people that are able to create amazing CSS designs, just hoping that one day I can get close to that level. Finally, I love watching youtube videos of game devs showing how they build games and implement new features. As you can see most of these interests come from me being fascinated with all the things people can create with technology I don't even fully understand yet.</p>
