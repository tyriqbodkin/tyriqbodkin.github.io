	<p>Fishing is something I've been interested in for a while, but I never actually got the chance to go fishing until this year(2022). Youtubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ybsyoungbloods">Brodie Moss</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OutdoorChefLife">Taku</a> are the reason I started getting interested in fishing during quarantine. Eventually my dad started getting interested in fishing again, and I was finally able to go with him arounf my 18th birthday. Because I mainly eat fish, fishing became one of the hobbies that helped me save money. Fishing is just something that helps me relax and get a chance to eat some of my favorite meals.</p>

	<p>I started playing piano in my freshman year of highschool. For as long as I can remember I was surrounded by musicians and singers and eventually that lead me to go down the same road. My grandma has been playing the piano for me for as long as I can remember so I developed an interest pretty early. In my freshman year I had a music teacher named Ms. Rege and she was extremely important to in the entire process of me learning piano. After that year I started getting more confident and began playing in church, which allowed me to grow a lot as a musician. Above is a video of me playing "Lift Me Up" by Rihanna before I went to see Black Panther 2.</p>
